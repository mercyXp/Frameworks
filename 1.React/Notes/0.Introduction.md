# Introduction

## What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** used to build user interfaces for `websites` and `web apps`.
It helps developers create **interactive** and **dynamic** pages without reloading the entire page.

React focuses on building small, reusable pieces called **components**.
Each component controls a part of the user interface (for example: a button, a menu, or a card).
By combining components, you can build complete applications.


## Why Use React?

### 1. Single Page Application (SPA)

* Normally, websites load a new page from the server every time you click a link.
* In a **Single Page Application**, React loads the page **once** and then only updates the parts that change.
* This makes the app **faster** and gives a **smooth user experience**.

### 2. Virtual DOM

* The **DOM** is the structure of a webpage (like a tree of elements).
* Updating the real DOM can be slow if many elements change.
* React uses a **Virtual DOM** (lightweight), which is a copy kept in memory.
* When something changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares it to the old version, and then updates **only the parts of the real page that need to change**.
* This process is called **reconciliation** and makes React very efficient.

### 3. Component-Based

* React breaks the interface into **small pieces** (components).
* Each component is easy to write, test, and reuse.
* This keeps the code **organized and clean**.

### 4. Declarative

* Instead of telling the browser **how** to update each step, you describe **what the UI should look like**, and React handles the updates for you.
* This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

### 5. Strong Community and Ecosystem

* React is supported by a **large community** and many ready-to-use libraries.
* It is maintained by **Meta (Facebook)** and trusted by many big companies.

## Summary

React is a tool for building **fast**, **interactive**, and **maintainable** web applications.
Its main ideas are:

* Build **Single Page Applications** for smooth user experience.
* Use a **Virtual DOM** for fast updates.
* Write code with **reusable components** for easier development.
