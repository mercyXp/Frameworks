# Setting Up a New React Project

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating a React app, you need:

* **Node.js** (includes npm, the Node Package Manager)
* Optional: **Yarn** (alternative package manager)

### Check if Node.js is installed

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

* If the commands show versions, Node.js and npm are installed.
* If not, download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) and install the **LTS version**.

## 2. Creating a React App with Vite (Recommended)

Vite is **fast** and modern. It sets up a React project quickly.

### Steps:

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on MacOS).

2. Run the following command to create a new React app:

```bash
# Replace my-app with your project name
npm create vite@latest my-app
```

3. Select your options:

* Framework: `React`
* Variant: `JavaScript` or `TypeScript`

4. Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd my-app
```

5. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to see your React app.

## 3. Creating a React App with Create React App (Deprecated)

You may encounter older projects using **Create React App**.

### Steps:

```bash
# Install CRA globally (optional)
npm install -g create-react-app

# Create a new React app
npx create-react-app my-app

# Navigate into the folder
cd my-app

# Start the development server
npm start
```

* Your app will run at `http://localhost:3000`.
* Note: CRA is slower than Vite and is no longer recommended for new projects.

## 4. Manual Setup (Advanced, Optional)

For learning purposes, you can set up React **without Vite or CRA**:

1. Create a new folder and initialize npm:

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
npm init -y
```

2. Install React and ReactDOM:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

3. Set up **Babel** to convert modern JS/JSX to browser-compatible code.

4. Set up **Webpack** to bundle your app.

5. Create your React components and use `npm scripts` or Webpack Dev Server to run the app.

> Manual setup helps you understand the inner workings of React but is **not recommended for beginners**.

---

## 5. Summary

* **Vite:** Fast, modern, recommended for new projects.
* **Create React App:** Works for older projects, slower.
* **Manual setup:** Educational, for advanced users.

Always make sure **Node.js and npm** are installed before starting.
