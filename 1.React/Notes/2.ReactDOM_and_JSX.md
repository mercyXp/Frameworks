# ReactDOM & JSX

## What is the DOM?

The **DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface for web pages.

* It represents the page as a **tree of nodes**, where each node is an element, attribute, or piece of text.
* This allows programs, like JavaScript, to **interact with and change the page**.
* With the DOM, you can:

  * Add, remove, or modify elements
  * Change styles
  * Respond to events (clicks, typing, etc.)

**Example:**
When you load a webpage, the HTML is converted into a DOM. JavaScript can then use the DOM to update the page dynamically.

## What is ReactDOM?

**ReactDOM** is a React package that lets your React app **interact with the browserâ€™s DOM**.

* It acts as a **bridge** between React and the browser.
* For example, it helps React render your components to the web page.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

* Here, `ReactDOM.createRoot` connects React to the HTML element with id `root`.
* Then, `root.render(<App />)` displays your React component on the page.

## What is the Virtual DOM?

The **Virtual DOM** is a **lightweight copy** of the real DOM.

* Instead of updating the real DOM directly (which is slow), React first updates the **Virtual DOM**.
* React then **compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one** to find what changed.
* Finally, it updates **only the changed parts** of the real DOM.

**Why it matters:**

* Faster updates
* Smoother user interactions
* Efficient rendering even for complex apps

## What is JSX?

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.

* It allows you to write **HTML-like code inside JavaScript**.
* React converts JSX into regular JavaScript that the browser can understand.

**Example:**

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my app.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* `<div>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` look like HTML, but they are actually JSX inside JavaScript.
* JSX makes it **easy to visualize and structure your components**.
