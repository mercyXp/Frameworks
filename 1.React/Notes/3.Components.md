# Components & Component Lifecycle in React

## What Are Components?

Think of **components** as small building blocks of a website—like **Lego bricks**.
Each component represents a piece of the user interface (UI), for example:

* A button
* A navigation bar
* An input form

Just like Lego pieces, **components can be reused** and combined to create bigger, more complex web pages.
This makes React projects easier to build and maintain.

## Types of Components

### 1. Class Components

* **Structure**: Written using ES6 classes and extend `React.Component`.
* **State & Lifecycle**: Can manage state and use lifecycle methods.
* **Syntax**: Slightly longer and uses a `render()` method.
* **Use today**: Mostly seen in older (legacy) projects.

**Example:**

```jsx
import { Component } from 'react';

class Welcome extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Functional Components

* **Structure**: Simple JavaScript functions (can also be arrow functions).
* **State & Features**: With **Hooks** (like `useState` and `useEffect`), they can handle state and lifecycle events.
* **Syntax**: Shorter, easier to read, and now the most common way to write React code.

**Example:**

```jsx
const Welcome = () => {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
```

### Key Differences

| Feature     | Class Component   | Functional Component      |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| State       | Built-in          | With Hooks (`useState`)   |
| Lifecycle   | Lifecycle methods | Hooks (`useEffect`)       |
| Code length | Longer            | Shorter & cleaner         |
| Current use | Older projects    | Preferred in new projects |

## Component Lifecycle

A **component lifecycle** is the series of steps a component goes through:

1. **Mounting** – The component is created and added to the page.
2. **Updating** – The component changes when its state or props change.
3. **Unmounting** – The component is removed from the page.

### Main Lifecycle Stages (Class Components)

* **Mounting**

  * `constructor()` – Initialize state or bind methods.
  * `render()` – Return the UI (JSX).
  * `componentDidMount()` – Runs after the component appears on the page (good for API calls or starting timers).

* **Updating**

  * `shouldComponentUpdate()` – Decide if the UI should update.
  * `render()` – Runs again to show the updated UI.
  * `componentDidUpdate()` – Runs after updates (useful for DOM changes or new API calls).

* **Unmounting**

  * `componentWillUnmount()` – Clean up (stop timers, remove event listeners, etc.).

## Lifecycle in Functional Components

Functional components don’t use lifecycle *methods*.
Instead, **Hooks** (like `useEffect`) handle these events:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Runs after the component mounts or updates
  return () => {
    // Runs before the component unmounts (cleanup)
  };
}, []);
```

---

### Key Takeaways

* Components are **reusable UI blocks** (like Lego pieces).
* **Functional components with Hooks** are now the recommended way to build React apps.
* Understanding the **lifecycle** helps you know **when** to fetch data, update the DOM, or clean up resources.
