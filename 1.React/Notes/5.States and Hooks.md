# States and Hooks 

## What is State?

**State** is like a **memory** for a React component.
It stores data that can **change over time** (for example, when a user clicks a button or types in a text box).

When the **state changes**, React **automatically updates (re-renders)** the UI to match the new data.
This is what makes React apps dynamic and interactive.

### Why State is Important

* **Dynamic Content:** Lets components respond to user actions, API responses, or timers.
  Example: The number of items in a shopping cart.
* **Automatic Updates:** When state changes, the UI refreshes automatically without manual DOM updates.
* **Component Isolation:** Each component manages its own state, making apps easier to debug.
* **Behavior Control:** State can control things like whether a modal is open, which tab is active, or if a button is disabled.

## Simple State Example

Here’s a **counter** that increases when you click a button:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // count = current value, setCount = function to update it

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### How It Works

1. **useState(0)** creates a state variable `count` starting at `0`.
2. `setCount(count + 1)` updates the state when the button is clicked.
3. React automatically **re-renders** the component with the new `count`.

## What are Hooks?

**Hooks** are special functions that let you:

* Use **state** and other React features in **functional components**.
* Reuse logic between components.

Before Hooks (React 16.8), you needed **class components** to use state or lifecycle features. Hooks make functional components powerful and easier to write.

### Common Hooks

| Hook           | Purpose                                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **useState**   | Add state to functional components.                                               |
| **useEffect**  | Perform side effects (fetching data, setting up timers, updating the DOM).        |
| **useContext** | Access global data from React Context.                                            |
| **useReducer** | Manage complex state with reducers (like Redux logic).                            |
| **useRef**     | Access DOM elements or persist values between renders without causing re-renders. |

### Example with `useEffect`

`useEffect` lets you run code after the component renders—similar to lifecycle methods in class components.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This runs after every render
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Example;
```

* `useEffect` updates the **browser tab title** every time `count` changes.

---

## Rules of Hooks

1. **Only call Hooks at the top level** of your component.
   (Not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.)
2. **Only call Hooks in React functions**
   (functional components or custom Hooks, not regular JS functions).

These rules ensure React tracks the state and effects correctly.

---

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own Hooks to reuse logic across components.

Example idea:

* A custom hook to **fetch data from an API**.
* A hook to manage **dark mode**.

This keeps code **clean and reusable**.

---

### Key Takeaways

* **State** stores changing data inside components and triggers UI updates.
* **Hooks** let you use state, side effects, and other React features in functional components.
* `useState` and `useEffect` are the most common hooks to master first.
