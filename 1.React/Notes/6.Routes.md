# React Router

## What is Routing?

**Routing** is the process of deciding **which page or content to show** based on the **URL** the user visits.

* In a **traditional website**, every time you click a link:

  * The browser sends a request to the server.
  * The server responds with a **new HTML page**.
  * The whole page **reloads**.

* In a **Single Page Application (SPA)** like a React app:

  * The app loads **one main HTML page** at the start.
  * Clicking a link **changes the URL** but **does not reload the page**.
  * JavaScript (and a routing library) **swaps components** to show new content instantly.

This creates a **faster and smoother experience**, similar to using a desktop or mobile app.

## Why React Router?

**React Router** is the most popular library for handling routing in React apps.
It lets you:

* Define **paths** (like `/`, `/about`, `/contact`) and connect them to specific **components**.
* Navigate between views **without refreshing the page**.
* Manage **browser history**, so the **back/forward buttons and bookmarks** work correctly.

## Key Concepts in React Router

| Concept           | What it Means                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Route**         | A path (URL) and the component it should display.             |
| **Link**          | A React Router version of an anchor `<a>` tag for navigation. |
| **BrowserRouter** | Wraps your app to enable routing features.                    |
| **useParams**     | Hook to read dynamic values from the URL (e.g. `/users/:id`). |
| **useNavigate**   | Hook to move the user to a different page programmatically.   |

## Simple Example

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Install React Router:**

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Basic Routes:**

```jsx
// App.jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
  return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

**How it works:**

* `BrowserRouter` sets up routing for the app.
* `Link` changes the URL **without reloading the page**.
* `Routes` and `Route` tell React which component to show for each URL.

## Dynamic Routes Example

You can create routes with **parameters** (like user IDs):

```jsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function Profile() {
  const { username } = useParams();
  return <h2>Hello, {username}!</h2>;
}

// Route: <Route path="/user/:username" element={<Profile />} />
```

Visiting `/user/Alice` will show:
`Hello, Alice!`

## Key Benefits of React Router

* **Fast Navigation**: Switch between pages instantly.
* **SEO-Friendly**: URLs look clean (`/about`, `/contact`).
* **Browser History Support**: Back and forward buttons work like normal.

---

## Practice

1. Build a small React app with three pages: **Home**, **About**, and **Contact**.
2. Use `<Link>` to navigate between pages.
3. Add a dynamic page, like `/products/:id`, to practice URL parameters.
