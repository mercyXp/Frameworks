# Prop Drilling & Context API (React)

## What is Prop Drilling?

**Prop drilling** happens when you need to send data from a top-level component to a deeply nested child component, but the data must pass through several “middle” components that do not actually need it.

* Data is passed using **props** (the normal way to share data in React).
* Every component in the chain must forward the data, even if they don’t use it.

### Why It Can Be a Problem

* **Complexity**: Too many layers make the code harder to follow.
* **Messy Props**: Middle components get extra props they don’t care about.
* **Less Reusable**: Components become tightly linked to their parents.
* **Hard to Update**: Changing the structure means updating many components.

## The Context API: A Better Way

The **Context API** lets you share data with any component in the tree **without** passing it through every level.

1. **Create a Context** – Think of it as a shared container for data.
2. **Provide the Data** – Use a `Provider` to wrap the part of the app that needs access.
3. **Consume the Data** – Use the `useContext` hook to get the data in any child.

### Example

**Prop Drilling (not ideal)**:

```jsx
function Grandparent({ data }) {
  return <Parent data={data} />;
}

function Parent({ data }) {
  return <Child data={data} />;
}

function Child({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

**Using Context API (better)**:

```jsx
const DataContext = React.createContext();

function Grandparent({ data }) {
  return (
    <DataContext.Provider value={data}>
      <Parent />
    </DataContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Parent() {
  return <Child />;
}

function Child() {
  const data = React.useContext(DataContext);
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

Here, the `Child` can access the data directly—no need to pass it through `Parent`.

## Other Solutions

* **Component Composition**: Design components so you can pass only what’s needed directly as children.
* **State Management Libraries**: Tools like **Redux**, **MobX**, or **Zustand** give you a central store for app-wide data.

## Key Takeaway

Prop drilling works for small apps, but it quickly becomes hard to manage as your app grows.
Using **Context API** (or a state management library) makes your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more scalable.
